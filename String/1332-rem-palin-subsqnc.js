/** 
 * Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}

var removePalindromeSub = function(s) {
  let n= s.length;
  if(n===0) return 0;
  for(let i=0; i<Math.floor(n/2); i++){
      if(s[i] !== s[n-i-1])
          return 2;
}  
  return 1;
